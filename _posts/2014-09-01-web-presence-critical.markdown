  <p>Your Internet presence is vital.  According to the <a href="http://www.sba.gov/blogs/build-your-business-great-web-presence-1" target="_blank">Small Business Association 53% of small businesses do not have a website</a>!</p>

  <p>But it's not enough to just have a website anymore.  You need to be where your existing customers and your future customers are.  That means you need a beautiful, robust, web application that engages your visitors, a social media focus, and fresh content everywhere.  You need a plan!</p>

  <p>Oh, and let's not forget how your customers are finding you and how they are viewing your brand.  One-third of all Internet traffic to your site is on mobile according to <a href="http://www.walkersandsdigital.com/Walker-Sands-Mobile-Traffic-Report-Q1-2014" target="_blank">reports</a>.  This is why you need to have an adaptive website that looks beautiful on phones, tablets, and computers.</p>

  <p>In the end, you just want to run your business, let a professional agency like {{ site.title }} run your web.</p>
