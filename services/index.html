        <p>We don't use the term <em>website</em> much.  To us, it sounds like "answering machine" or "floppy disk".  It implies that the place you live on the Internet is a simple static presentation of facts; like a pamphlet or business card.</p>
        <h4>Websites are dead. Long live web apps!</h4>
        <p>Too many "business websites" present themselves like business cards and read like pamphlets.  When a visitor finds you online, the last thing you want is to have them toss you into the virtual rolodex for later.</p>

        <blockquote>Your web application should be a dedicated, tireless, machine that performs all the necessary functions that your audience will need.</blockquote>

        <p>We can help you focus your web vision.  {{site.title}} is an expert in turning your web property into a complete experience for your visitors based on what your specific audience is after.</p>
